(57192157615)","As crises, both natural and man-made, continue to escalate in frequency and complexity, the need for effective and timely humanitarian interventions has become increasingly critical. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in enhancing humanitarian aid, addressing all stages of the crisis management cycle. Despite growing interest in AI's application within the humanitarian field, the existing literature remains fragmented, with limited synthesis of its overall impact. This study adopts a systematic literature review approach to provide a comprehensive analysis of AI's utilization in humanitarian aid across the crisis cycle, as well as its role in broader humanitarian settings outside of immediate crisis contexts. Based on 60 selected studies, the findings reveal that AI applications in both the pre- and post-crisis phases can be grouped into four specific categories, and that AI's role in broader humanitarian contexts can similarly be divided into four focus areas. Specifically, the categories in the pre-crisis phase include site selection, medical services enhancement, early warning, and information flow, and the categories in the post-crisis phase include distribution and delivery, damage assessment, online and textual insights, and routing optimization. The review highlights AI's significant potential to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of humanitarian efforts, offering valuable insights for organizations seeking to harness AI's transformative power. © 2025 The Authors",2026-01-01,Scopus,C,A,Technovation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2025.103415,0,,0,Scopus,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105020375829&doi=10.1016%2Fj.technovation.2025.103415&partnerID=40&md5=029720467f58ac6f8843c48dce881060

Integrating these tools presents significant opportunities to support circular strategies in the construction industry. This systematic review assesses the current state of research, emerging technologies, and key methodologies for DT and MP adoption. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols, academic and practice-based publications examining MP regulatory frameworks, technological advancements, and functionalities were systematically reviewed. The review identifies critical gaps in the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), highlights the limited scalability of current MP frameworks, and proposes a path forward through dynamic material passports (DMPs) - a concept where MPs are continuously updated throughout a building's lifecycle via DT integration. The primary contribution of this study lies in synthesizing fragmented literature on MPs and DTs, proposing a comprehensive and lifecycle-oriented framework to enable real-time material tracking, and highlighting the transition toward scalable, data-driven circular solutions in construction. The review reveals the following findings: (1) inadequate investigation into AI and IoT technologies within the MP context; (2) the potential benefit of combining MPs with DT technology to create DMPs; and (3) limited applicability of current methodologies to existing building stocks, as they are often complex and tailored to new construction projects. These findings offer a foundation for future development and adoption of DMPs, and inform policies, practices, and digital strategies aimed at enhancing circularity in the built environment. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2026-01-01,Scopus,,A*,Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,https://doi.org/10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-16899,0,,0,Scopus,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105022114628&doi=10.1061%2FJCEMD4.COENG-16899&partnerID=40&md5=00232f3ee88fdf552cccd1a10181c185

However, the existing prediction methods face key challenges, such as their insufficient adaptability to dynamic working conditions, heavy reliance on high-quality data, and limited model generalizability, as well as the resource constraints imposed by edge devices. In this paper, model-driven, data-driven and hybrid methods are comprehensively analysed to highlight their advantages and limitations. Model-driven approaches have strong interpretability, but they face challenges in terms of their computational complexity and adaptability to dynamic conditions. Data-driven methods perform well in terms of flexibility, real-time deployment and lightweight computing. However, these methods usually require high-quality data. Hybrid methods combine physical interpretability with data-driven real-time performance, effectively reducing their reliance on high-quality data and significantly improving their accuracy and generalizability in different operational scenarios. Future battery state management research must prioritize lightweight modelling, quantum computing for atomic-level electrochemical simulations, and meta-learning for adaptive battery management systems (BMSs) to overcome the current deployment limitations. These advancements will jointly drive BMS technology towards higher efficiency, safety and sustainability levels, bridging the gap between laboratory research and industrial applications. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025-01-01,Scopus,B,A,Journal of Cleaner Production,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2025.146229,0,,2,Scopus,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105011160683&doi=10.1016%2Fj.jclepro.2025.146229&partnerID=40&md5=7ac5197e08df1bd89e9af40975195c57

This study addresses this gap by systematically reviewing and analyzing research from 2015 to 2024, focusing on how different information sharing factors contribute to bullwhip effect mitigation. We reviewed 57 articles to gain insights into five critical factors: what information is shared, how it is shared, with whom it is shared, why it is shared, and the direction of information sharing. Our analysis indicates that “why to share” and “what to share” are the most frequently studied dimensions, while “how to share,” “with whom to share,” and “the direction of information sharing” have been less explored. This study underscores the need for further research on these less examined factors and enhances understanding of their role in mitigating the bullwhip effect.

Consequently, our study analyzes relevant scientific literature on the topic of MCS from 1970 to 2022, through the use of VOSviewer, R Bibliometrix and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to visualize the bibliometric results. Findings: The study provides a comprehensive overview of key emerging topics in MCS literature and the ways in which they have developed over the decades, along with a structured research agenda built upon the literature gaps found amid current and past scientific production. It does so by analyzing scientific production from multiple bibliometric aspects and advanced text-mining techniques to extract common emerging themes from the dataset. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no attempt has yet been made to synthesize MCS literature through a bibliometric review. The bibliometric perspective on MCS enhances scholars' understanding of the historical path and future trends of the literature stream, while helping practitioners update existing MCS conceptualizations in light of contemporary changes. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2025-01-01,Scopus,C,B,International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPPM-07-2023-0334,0,,1,Scopus,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198056222&doi=10.1108%2FIJPPM-07-2023-0334&partnerID=40&md5=399264f0bbd49c63ce5737eab98e4392
